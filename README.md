# Text Analysis Project

> **Note**: This project is a school assignment for a serverless computing course, implemented using Apache OpenWhisk.

This project was developed as part of a group assignment by:

- Nathan Stampfli
- Jason Leroy
- Thomas Moumousseau
- Amine Affif

(5aCTO)

> **Warning**: The serverless part of this project is not fully functional and serves only as a project trace. The traditional Python implementation works perfectly fine.

This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing text files. It includes functionalities such as word frequency analysis, word cloud generation, sentence summarization, and various visualizations. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Traditional Python Implementation**: A fully functional implementation that processes text files using Python scripts.
2. **Serverless Implementation**: A project trace demonstrating how the same functionalities can be implemented using Apache OpenWhisk, though it is not fully functional.

## Project Overview

The Text Analysis Project is designed to analyze text files and provide insightful data through various methods:

- **Text Analysis**: Compute basic statistics about the text, including sentence count, word count, unique word count, lexical diversity, and average sentence length.
- **Word Cloud**: Generate a word cloud image from the most frequent words.
- **Distributions**: Plot distributions of word lengths and parts of speech (POS) tags.
- **Summarization**: Generate a concise summary of the text.

Each part of the project has its own detailed README file that provides specific instructions on how to set up and use that part of the project. You can access these instructions by clicking on the respective directory in the GitHub repository.

## Structure

- **text_analysis/**: Directory containing the fully functional traditional Python implementation.
- **serverless/**: Directory containing the serverless project trace for Apache OpenWhisk.

## Usage

### Traditional Python Implementation

The traditional Python implementation is fully functional and can be used to analyze text files effectively. For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to the `README.md` file in the `text_analysis` directory.

### Serverless Implementation

The serverless implementation provides a project trace of how the functionalities can be implemented using Apache OpenWhisk. This part of the project is not fully functional and should be used for reference purposes only. For detailed setup and usage instructions, please refer to the `README.md` file in the `serverless` directory.
